  abstract = {A new k-{$\epsilon$} eddy viscosity model, which consists of a new model dissipation rate equation and a new realizable eddy viscosity formulation, is proposed in this paper. The new model dissipation rate equation is based on the dynamic equation of the mean-square vorticity fluctuation at large turbulent Reynolds number. The new eddy viscosity formulation is based on the realizability constraints; the positivity of normal Reynolds stresses and the Schwarz' inequality for turbulent shear stresses. We find that the present model with a set of unified model coefficients can perform well for a variety of flows. The flows that are examined include: (i) rotating homogeneous shear flows; (ii) boundary-free shear flows including a mixing layer, planar and round jets; (iii) a channel flow, and flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient; and (iv) backward facing step separated flows. The model predictions are compared with available experimental data. The results from the standard k-{$\epsilon$} eddy viscosity model are also included for comparison. It is shown that the present model is a significant improvement over the standard k-{$\epsilon$} eddy viscosity model.},
